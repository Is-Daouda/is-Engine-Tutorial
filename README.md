## ![danger](https://i48.servimg.com/u/f48/20/16/75/27/icon_d10.png) Very important
Since the game engine has evolved a lot, some part of the Youtube tutorial no longer corresponds to this one!<br/>
These details mentioned below allow to adapt this new version of the engine to the youtube tutorial:
1. Music files in **.ogg** format have been replaced by **.wav**.
2. The constructor of the scenes classes have changed :
- This constructor has been replaced (take the case of the **GameMenu class**) :
```cpp
GameMenu(sf::RenderWindow &window, sf::View &view, is::Render &surface, is::GameSystemExtended &gameSysExt):
	GameDisplay(window, view, surface, gameSysExt, sf::Color::Black /* => scene color*/) {}
```
- By this one :
```cpp
GameMenu(is::GameSystemExtended &gameSysExt):
	GameDisplay(gameSysExt, sf::Color::Black /* => scene color*/) {}
```

### Description:
This project is for use with the [Youtube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/wo2-ofNB7Hw) which shows how to create a game with is::Engine.
It already contains the resources (sprites, sounds, fonts) for creating the game.
